# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project aims to predict breast cancer using a machine learning model. The model achieves an accuracy of 96% in its predictions, indicating its effectiveness.

## Description

In this project, we use a breast cancer dataset to train a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The model is based on binary classification analysis and utilizes deep learning techniques with TensorFlow.

## How to Use the Project

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow

### Download the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

### Run the Notebook

Open the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute each cell in the notebook. This will train the model and generate predictions.

### Explore the Results

Once you have executed all the cells, you can explore the obtained results. The model will provide an accuracy of 96% in the predictions made.
